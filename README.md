# Barbu

A peer-to-peer multiplayer online card playing game of [Barbu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbu_(card_game))

Made with [peer.js](https://peerjs.com/) and [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Client-only: The browser of the game's host acts as the server, though a dedicated [Peer.js
server](https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server) is recommended (can be deployed for free on Heroku).
